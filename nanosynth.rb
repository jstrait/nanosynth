###
### This is a very simple sound generator capable of creating sound based on
### five types of wave: sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, and noise.
###
### This is intended for educational purposes, to show an example
### of how to create sound using Ruby. Clarity has been favored over
### performance, error-handling, succinctness, etc.
###
### Example usage:
###   ruby nanosynth.rb sine 440.0 0.2
###
### This will create a Wave file called "mysound.wav" in the current
### working directory, containing a 440Hz sine wave at 20% full volume.
### You should be able to play this file in pretty much any media player.
###
### This program requires the WaveFile gem:
###
###   gem install wavefile --version 0.8.1
###
### If you're on a Mac, you can generate the sound and play it at the same time
### by using the afplay command:
###
###   ruby nanosynth.rb sine 440.0 0.5 && afplay mysound.wav
###
### For more detail about how all of this works, check out this blog post:
